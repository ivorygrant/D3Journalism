          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Obesity</h2>
          <p>There is an alarming trend in the United States: Citizens in lower income States tend
            to have higher BMI. Addressing this issue publically, President Trump has declared a war
            on income, and has asked his administration to recommend initiatives to fight this scourge.
            "We will not allow, all this low income stuff, to stop us from Making America Great Again"
            he said in his announcement. The President has also called on Vice President Mike Pence to assist
            in his efforts. "I have asked our wonderful, so wonderful, Vice President Pence, to
            pray on this issue, as he has done in the past while governeor of the great Hoosier state of
            Indiana." After the White House Press Conference, First Lady Melania Trump was seen sporting
            an H&M jacket with the phrase "I Really Don't Care. Do you?"</p>
